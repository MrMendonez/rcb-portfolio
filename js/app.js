When we were launching the company in our first class at Rutgers University I contacted this person for a potential TA opportunity. At the time he was teaching Web Design and Computer Applications at South Brunswick High School in New Jersey. And the conversation quickly turned to his interest in joining as a student. And his motivation to join the program was to gain a web development skill set and bring it back to his school district to create a curriculum that would impact lives at the middle school and high school level. So he came into the program and he quickly flourished and became one of the most dedicated and talented individuals in the classroom. He landed a job as a web developer almost immediately after graduation. And he never lost sight of his core why or his why he joined the program - his core motivation. And fast-forward a year and a half later he\'s now a consultant for Freehold High School in New Jersey. He is building a curriculum that\'ll change hopefully students\' lives at the high school level and he\'s taking their teachers through a mini-bootcamp to make sure they have the skills to be effective as educators.
